### Theorem: Binomial Expansion

Let $a, b in RR$, and $n in NN$.

$$
forall a,b in RR, n in NN : (a+b)^n = sum_{k=0}^n a^k b^{n-k} (&{n;k})
$$


### Theorem: Pythagorean

Let there be a right triangle in Eucledean space with perpendicular side lengths $a$ and $b$ and a hypotenuse of length $c$,

then:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

### Definition: Matrix Exponential

(The exponential function is redefined as its Taylor Series for a matrix)

Let M be a matrix of size $n xx n, n in NN$

Then:

$$
forall M in M_n(RR) : exp(M) = sum_{n=0}^{+inf} M^n/n!
$$
