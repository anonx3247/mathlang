# Mathlang

#### By: Neosapien

This project aims to create a much lighter and more orthogonal syntax for mathematical writing on the computer
instead of trying to replace LaTeX as a *typesetting* system, mathlang aims only to change they *syntax*.

Thus mathlang converts its own syntax to pure math latex code, allowing you to write in something readable and comfortable
while always allowing you to change to a syntax understood by every math typesetting program wether it be Latex, Markdown, HTML,
or other.

## Installation

(Note: this will run only on Linux/MacOS/Unix (i.e. not windows))

You need the [go language](https://go.dev/) installed
as well as [git](https://git-scm.com/) (this should already be installed on MacOS)

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neosapien3247/mathlang
cd mathlang
```

To test it out run:

```bash
make
```

To install run:

```bash
sudo make install
```

(Note: while testing, the binary has to be in the same directory as `syntax_regexp.json` to find it)

## Usage


## Brief Presentation

Here you can see a few examples of what mathlang is capable of:

### Vectors, hats, and column vectors
##### Mathlang
```
u^{->} : [{ i^{^}; j^{^}}] 
```
##### LaTeX
```latex
\overrightarrow{u} : \left[\begin{matrix} \hat{i}\\ \hat{j}\end{matrix}\right] 
```
### Sets, / alternate symbols
##### Mathlang
```
RR^{_} = RR cup \{+- inf\}
```
##### LaTeX
```latex
\overline{\mathbb{R}} = \mathbb{R} \cup \{\pm \infty\}
```
### Sums, fractions, matrices (`\binom`)
##### Mathlang
```
sum_{k=0}^n ({n;k}) ( alpha/beta )^{n-k} ( gamma/delta )^k = ( alpha/beta + gamma/delta )^n
```
##### LaTeX
```latex
\sum_{k=0}^n \left(\begin{matrix}n\\k\end{matrix}\right) \left( \frac{\alpha}{\beta}
\right)^{n-k} \left( \frac{\gamma}{\delta} \right)^k =
\left( \frac{\alpha}{\beta} + \frac{\gamma}{\delta} \right)^n
```
### Matrices
##### Mathlang
```
A = ({a,b,c;d,e,f;g,h,i})
```
##### LaTeX
```latex
A = \left(\begin{matrix}a & b & c\\d & e & f\\g & h & i\end{matrix}\right)
```

## Dependencies
This uses standard go libraries so it doesn't need particular dependencies, simply install go.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neosapien3247/mathlang
```
```bash
cd mathlang
```
Then to build run:
```bash
make
```
and to install to `/usr/local/bin` run
```bash
sudo make install
```

## Syntax
See the [wiki](https://github.com/neosapien3247/mathlang/wiki) for syntax

##  Usage

```bash
mathlang -e "expression"
```
This will output the "translation" of the expression into \LaTeX

```bash
... | mathlang -
```
This will output the `STDIN` translated into \LaTeX
This can be very useful in certain editors for example, `kakoune`
by piping the content of a line and binding it, you can translate
mathlang to \LaTeX on the fly in one keystroke.

```bash
mathlang -d
```

This allows you to only convert what is between delimiters for mathlang code,
thus allowing you to pipe an entire **file** into the converter and only change things between
the delimiters. (the delimiters are $$)

This allows `mathlang` to be used as a preprocessor, e.g:
```bash
mathlang -df "myfile.md" | pandoc -o myfile.pdf
```

## Examples

Here are a few examples of the benefits of this system:

### No more backslashes

```
forall x in A, exists y in B
```

```latex
\forall x \in A, \exists y \in B
````

```
sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1
```

```latex
\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1
```
### Intelligent, elegant fractions

```
5/3 , 2 + {2 - 6t}/{3+8m}, {-3 + 5}/2c+6 a+b/c
```
  

```latex
\frac{5}{3} , 2 + \frac{2 - 6t}{3+8m}, \frac{-3 + 5}{2c+6} \frac{a+b}{c}
```

They even handle fractions of fractions:

```
varphi = 1 + 1/{1 + 1/{1 + 1/{1 + ...}}}
```

```latex
\varphi = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \cdots}}}
```

### Smart annotations

Wether its vectors, conjugates, or hats, mathlang has better syntax!

```
a^{^}, b^{_}, c^{->}, d^{~}
```

```latex
\hat{a}, \overline{b}, \overrightarrow{c}, \tilde{d}
```

### Automatically takes the best choices

Parenthesis are already chosen to be the size-adjusting type, wether you need them or not:

```
(a+b)
```
  
```latex
\left(a+b\right)
```

Also note that this works for pipes `|` but with specific rules:
1. pipes that are surrounded by whitespace do not get changed and stay as `|`
2. if pipes are stuck only on one side to non whitespace they get changed
3. if there is no whitespace the pipes will not be changed.

```
5 + |-3| = 8
```

```latex
5 + \left|-3\right| = 8
```

```
\{ x^2 | x in RR \}
```

```latex
\left\{ x^2 | x \in \mathbb{R} \right\}
```

### Simple, memorable shortcuts

```
forall n in NN^{*}, forall x in RR, x >= 1 => |x^n| >= x
```

```latex
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}^{*}, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, x \ge 1 \implies |x^n| \ge x
```

```
RR^{_} = RR cup \{ +- inf\}
```

```latex
\overline{\mathbb{R}} = \mathbb{R} \cup \{ \pm \infty\}
```
### Matrices, made easy

```
A = (&{a,b,c;d,e,f;g,h,i})
```

```latex
A = \left(\begin{matrix} a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & i \end{matrix}\right)
```

It can also be good for other formatting:

```
(a+b)^n = sum_{k=0}^n (&{n;k}) a^k b^{n-k}
```

```latex
\left(a+b\right)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \left(\begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix}\right) a^k b^{n-k}
```

### Case statements

```
@{ f : RR, -> RR; x, |-> x^2}
```
  
```latex
\begin{cases}  f : \mathbb{R} &  \to \mathbb{R} \\  x &  \mapsto x^2 \end{cases}
```


## You can test it out yourself with the test file (`test.md`) to get the `test.pdf` output with pandoc
